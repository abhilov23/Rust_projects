The Whispering Breeze

Beneath the sky so wide and blue,
The trees sway gently, old and true.
The sun dips low, a golden hue,
The world feels still, refreshed, and new.

A whispering breeze begins to play,
Dancing softly, night meets day.
It hums a tune, so light, so free,
A song of life, for you and me.

The stars above begin to gleam,
Their twinkle bright, a distant dream.
And as the world drifts into rest,
The breeze declares, "Life is its best."
